- = not done / to be implemented
T = should be tested
✓ = done

	RunBB
- "runBB" will run the service
- No warning or communication should be sent during runBB, except there should be an error message when an error occured
- The error message should be "there was an error in the execution, for more details check log.txt in the home directory."
- Any error met should be logged in log.txt which is located in the $HOME directory
- The script should look through the present and sub directories
- It should check each file
- Everytime a match is found, it should be copied to the destination
- The copied file should have the name changed with the date of the file creation, and the owner of the file
- If the name of the file already exists in the destination folder, the name should get a 1 on the end, if that exists it should get a 2 etc.
- Compressed files will not be extracted


	ConfigureBB
- "configureBB" can only be ran before "runBB"
T Order of options is irrelevant
T the parameter -d will specify the directory that contains the report and the copied files for "runBB" (what report??)
T if -d is not supplied, create a folder called archive in the current directory.
T if folder "archive" exists, create a new folder "archive1", if that exists, create "archive2" etc.
T the parameter -b specifies the name and location of the file with the bad words.
T if no -b is passed, the bad word list will consist of the word "bad"
T The user must receive a descriptive error in stderr for any non-valid option or parameter.
